\section{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
	\item We have demonstrated how the complexity of the coordination of behavioral model can be managed by specifying the coordination at language level.
	\item Moreover, we have demonstrated that the coordination between heterogenenous models must be formal as have been done by adls and coordination languages. 
	
	\item By specifying the coordination at language level, we are able to capture coordination patterns that enables to automate coordination between models. 
	
	\item However, current approaches that captures coordination pattern are fixed and rely on a general purpose language. 
	
	
	\item We have proposed a framework for coordination patterns approaches
	
	\item We have proposed \bcool 
	
	\item We have validated our approach by applying \bcool to define set of operators between tfsm and activity.

	\item metalanguage of correspondences
	\item data
	\item properties
