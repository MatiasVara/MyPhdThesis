\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusions}
In this thesis, we have managed the coordination of heterogeneous behavioral models by specifying coordination patterns at language level. To capture the specification of these patterns, we have proposed \bcool, a dedicated language for integrators. This specification at language level enables a system designer to automate the coordination between particular models. In the following, we summing up the main findings of this thesis. We finish this chapter by proposing future work. \todo{here you should state in first what you did, i.e., bcool. Then explain that the automatically generated coordination can be used for heterogeneous execution of different xdsml}   

\section{Overview}
	
	
This thesis has focused on the coordination of heterogeneous behavioral models to provide execution and verification of the global system behavior. In the background section, we studied approaches that aim at getting the global representation of an heterogeneous system, in both structural and behavioral way. Then, we focused on approaches that have achieved to automate the coordination between behavioral models by capturing coordination patterns at language level. These approaches proposed tools or frameworks that automate the coordination of heterogeneous behavioral models based on patterns.\todo{please do a little more on the previous text to explain clearly what you did and what you took from the state of the art. You're not speaking about coordination languages nor ADLs... please say a little about them}. We have noted that, in these approaches, the knowledge about the coordination is hidden inside a tool, thus limiting reasoning. Moreover, they express the coordination in a GPL thus limiting the verification and validation of the whole system. Based on the state-of-art approaches, we have determined that  :
	\begin{itemize}

	\item the specification of a coordination pattern is specified at language level;
	 
	\item it may be valuable to propose a dedicated language for the specification of coordination patterns; 
	 
	\item it may be valuable to generate a the coordination in a formal language to allow the system designers to realize verification and validation activities.
	
\end{itemize}
	  
To understand how current approaches have achieved to capture a given coordination pattern, we have proposed a framework for the specification of coordination patterns. We have determined three building-blocks:\todo{this sentence is too short. Take a little of time to explain that you found only four approaches that describe coordination patterns between heterogeneous languages} 


	\begin{itemize}
	\item a Language Behavioral Interface, which exposes partial information about the syntax and the behavioral semantics of languages for coordination purpose; 
	
	\item a Correspondence Rule, which specifies what and when elements from different languages must be coordinated;
	
	\item a Coordination Rule, which specify how the selected elements must be coordinated. 
\end{itemize}

This framework allowed us to presented the requirements for a language to capture coordination patterns. Based on these requirements, we proposed \bcool, a dedicated language to capture coordination patterns between languages. In our approach, we have proposed a language behavioral interface made of event types, \ie \dse. These event types act as coordination points on the language behavioral semantics. Then, we have proposed to specify coordination patterns by using operators that define a correspondence matching that selects instances of \dse, and a coordination rule that defines how the selected instances of \dse must be coordinated. Using \bcool, the know-how of a system designer is made explicit, stored in a human readable format and can be shared/reviewed. Furthermore, such coordination patterns, expressed at the language level, can be applied on particular models to automatically generate the corresponding coordination model in \ccsl language. The use of the formal \ccsl language to express the coordination allowed us to provide execution and verification of the coordinated system.
	
We implemented \bcool as a set of Eclipse plugins integrated into the GEMOC studio. {\color{red}The integrated studio has managed the task of integrators and system designers by providing dedicated workbenches}\todo{not sure what you meant but if I understood it well, you may rephrase it cleanly}. In the language workbench, an integrator can develop operators between languages. Then, in the modeling workbench, a system designer can use these operators to automate the coordination of models. We have proposed a dedicated language named \bflow that allows a system designer to specify what operators are applied on a set of models. Then, from this specification, a system designer can generate a model of coordination in \ccsl so that the whole system can be executed and verified.  
	
To validate our approach, we have presented the coordination of the heterogeneous models of a surveillance camera system. We modeled the different parts of the system by using the TFSM and Activity Languages. To coordinate these models, we have proposed a set of hierarchical coordination patterns that we captured by using \bcool operators. Unlike coordination frameworks in which the semantics of the hierarchical coordination is hidden, we have explicitly specified these patterns by using a dedicated language. We used this specification to generate the coordination for the surveillance camera system, and then we executed the overall system.


	  
\section{Future Works}
\bcool provides some perspectives to extend and to improve the work carried out in this thesis. We list the propositions we consider essential to the continuity of this work:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Extending \bcool to support the coordination of data:} System designers build coordination models to specify how models interact. The interactions between models can rely on events but also on data, \ie data-driven coordination. In this case, a model exchanges data with another model. With \bcool, we have managed interactions that rely on events, \ie control-driven coordination. To support the specification of coordination patterns that involve the exchange of data between models, we have to extend \bcool to support data driven coordination. More precisely, we have to add a way to specify when a value of a variable in a model is carried to a new value in a variable in another model. This makes arrive several questions:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \emph{What} value must be carry, \eg the first one, the last one;
				\item \emph{When} the value of two variables must be synchronized, \eg immediately after one of them changes, after a period;
				\item \emph{How} the value of a variable must be carry from one model to another, \eg the same value, with some conversion. 
			\end{itemize}
\todo{I do not like your questions there. It looks like research question while you're saying after that these are requirements for the data coordination rules. You may perhaps present it directly like that}			
			
	In \bcool, such information should be encoded in a \emph{data coordination rule}. In addition, the current coordination rule should be used to synchronize the events associated with the change of the value of a variable. Thus, the resulting model of coordination would have some \ccsl specification but also some code that represents the exchange of data between models. We have to investigate what language should be used to express such exchanges. For the first experimentation, Java could be fine. 
\todo{You should explain that, additionnaly to event coordinations on the modifications of the variable, you have to generate a configuration for the heterogeneous engine to know what data exchange must be handled and when.}	
	   	 
	\item \textbf{Generalizing the specification of correspondences by using a dedicated language:} In \bcool, the correspondence matching can capture implicit and explicit correspondences between elements of models. Currently, the explicit correspondence is only supported if one of the metamodel is modified to refer concepts from a different metamodel. To avoid such modification, we need a language to specify correspondences between concepts from different languages without modifying the metamodels \todo{(\eg like in megamodels~\cite{bzeivinmegamodel}\cite{AWM})}. Such a work is similar to the concept of user-defined connector types in which a system designer can define a new type of connector and the roles on which it applies \todo{I disagree on that}. By following this idea, a language dedicated for correspondence should enable the definition of connector types between concepts of the language syntax. Then, in a \bcool specification, the correspondence matching could rely on such an explicit correspondence to select the elements on which apply the coordination rule\todo{I disagree on that}. This is interesting in the case of allocation in which there is a model of the hardware, a model of the application and a mapping model that is often generated by using some heuristic. Thus, the mapping model can be the input for a \bcool specification to generate the coordination model that represents the deployment between the hardware model and the platform model.\todo{true :) }
	\item \textbf{Extending \bcool to generate a model of coordination in other language:} \bcool relies on \ccsl to express the coordination. However, we could rely on other coordination language to take advantages of the tooling from other environment. To do so, we have to investigate if the current event relations can be translated to another coordination language.\todo{bof...}
	
	\item \textbf{Using \bcool for the synthesis of the orchestrator for Co-Simulation of Functional Mock-up Units:} The analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) involves the use of physical components (for instance described by differential equations evaluated according to the continuous time simulation paradigm) but it also involves the use of cyber components (usually relying on discrete time or discrete event simulation paradigms). Each language comes with existing tooling and several simulation tools and techniques are needed for CPS simulation and analysis. In this context, the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)~\cite{fmibib2} is a tool independent standard to support the co-simulation of dynamic models. The FMI standard provides a well defined specification and API to integrate heterogeneous simulation components. One key requirement for Co-Simulation via FMI is to develop a Master Algorithm that orchestrates the steps of Co-Simulation~\cite{fmibib}. For instance, the master algorithm has to control the data exchange and the time advancement among individual simulations. The FMI standard, however, does not describe or limit the implementation of the master algorithms. Currently, it is specified each time a particular system has to be co-simulated, which remains tedious and error prone. An interesting future work would be to generate such algorithm from a \bcool specification and the particular model used. Currently, the control and timing coordination is well managed by \bcool. However, to exploit the data exchange proposed by the FMI standard, it is mandatory to first extend \bcool to support data-driven coordination. 
	
	\item \textbf{Generalizing the specification of coordination patterns between existing modeling languages:} The development of heterogeneous system is currently done by using different existing modeling languages like Matlab, SDL or Modelica, which are developed by using very different technologies. To specify coordination patterns between these languages, we have to investigate how to add support for existing modeling languages in \bcool. Currently, to capture the specification of coordination patterns, we rely on partial information about the syntax and the behavioral semantics of languages that is contained in the language behavioral interface. It is thus mandatory that current modeling languages expose part of its syntax and behavioral semantics. The language behavioral interface may be a standard way to do it. In other words, modeling languages could provide a language behavioral interface for coordination purpose. We have to investigate if the current language behavioral interface proposed in~\cite{sle13-combemale} is enough to support these languages. \todo{relax this last sentence since for sure it is not enough for some continuous time languages}   
				
		%\item It is thus mandatory a standard language behavioral interface. Such a language behavioral interface may be generated from code.   
	

	
	

	

	
		
				%\item To analyze CPS, some components can be easily described by differential equations, while others like communication networks require Discrete-Event Simulation (DEVS) techniques. As a result, several simulation tools and techniques are needed for CPS simulation and analysis. In particular, Co-Simulation (Cooperative Simulation) enables system designers to simulate individual components using different simulation tools.   
				
				%\item Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of several collaborating physical and computing components that interact through embedded communication capabilities. 
		
		
		
		%\item Theoretically, an MA for direct co-ordination among FMUs can be developed for each distributed simulation problem, but that would be expensive and subject to errors.
