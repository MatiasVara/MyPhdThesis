%\section{Context}

\begin{itemize}
	% context 
	% complex systems
	
	\item Nowadays devices are becoming more complex. They embed several subsystems with different characteristics that communicate and interact in many ways. For example, current cars can integrate an adaptive control cruise system, GPS tracking, fuel control system and soon on. Furthermore, these subsystems are widely coupled. For instance, the adaptive cruise system determines the way to get home depending on the GPS tacking, also, the fuel control system regulates the speed of the car depending on the level of fuel.
	
	% designing of complex systems
	\item This makes the designing of these systems very complex. A designer has to deal with the heterogeneity of each subsystem but also with the interaction between them. To reduce the complexity of such a development, the designing is split into different domains, \eg mechanical, electronic, software. The development is thus talcked by different domains experts.
	
	% Multiple DSMLs --> heterogenenous
	\item Model Driven Engineering (MDE) has addressed the problem of the development of application for complex systems by proposing Domain Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs). Each domain expert relies on a DSML to better describe its domain. As a result of such development, several models conforming to different DSMLs are developed and the specification of the overall system becomes \emph{heterogeneous}.
% problem
	\item At some point of development, these models have to be integrated to understand the system and its emerging behavior globally. A system designer has to specify how models and languages are related to each other, in both a structural and a behavioral way.
	 
	\item In this context, the GEMOC initiative proposes to coordinate and disseminate the research results regarding the support of the coordinated use of various modeling languages that will lead to the concept of globalization of modeling languages, that is, the use of multiple modeling languages to support coordinated development of diverse aspects of a system. 
	
	\item This thesis is part of GEMOC initiative. More precisely, we focus on the coordination~\cite{coordsignibib} of behavioral models/languages to provide simulation and/or verification capabilities for the whole system specification. 
	
	
% partial solution
	\item Currently, Coordination Languages~\cite{coordsignibib} and Architecture Description Languages (ADLs)~\cite{frameadlsbib} provide dedicated languages to specify the coordination between particular behavioral models. This is usually done by system designers that apply some coordination patterns according to their own skills and know-how. However, in heterogeneous systems, the manual coordination of models can become tedious and error prone. To automated this task, Coordination frameworks~\cite{ptoleframebib,modhelxbib} have encoded a coordination pattern inside a tool. These approaches, however, hide the semantics of the coordination. Moreover, they rely on a general purpose language (GPL) to express the coordination. As a result, the reasoning about how a system is coordinated remains very limited.  
	
% contribution
\item In this thesis, we deal with the coordination of heterogeneous behavioral models by leveraging on the system designer's skills. We propose a dedicated language named \bcool (standing as Behavioral Coordination Operator Language) that allows for capturing coordination patterns for a given set of DSMLs. These patterns are captured between languages, and then used to derive a coordination model automatically for models conforming to the targeted DSMLs. The coordination at the language level relies on a so-called \emph{language behavioral interface}. This interface exposes an abstraction of the language behavioral semantics in terms of Events. Thus, an integrator use \bcool to define operators to specify how events from different language behavioral interfaces interact. These operators are defined at language level but they are applied between models to coordinate their behavior. This results in a model of coordination in \ccsl, a declarative language that describes causal and temporal relationships between events. By relying on \ccsl, we provide verification and validation of the coordinated system.    

% outline	 		
\item The content of this thesis is organized  in six chapters. 

\item In Chapter~\ref{ch:background}, we present the background about the integration of structural and behavioral models. We categorize the background into approaches that compose models and approaches that coordinate models. In particular, we focus on approaches that have captured coordination pattern between languages in order to automate the coordination between models. This chapter states some requirements for a language to capture explicitly coordination patterns between languages.    

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:framework} presents a framework to characterize coordination pattern approaches. We use this framework to compare different approaches. From this study, we propose the requirements for a language to capture coordination patterns, \ie \bcool.  

\item In Chapter~\ref{ch:bcool}, we elaborate on our approach by presenting \bcool. We introduce a running example: the heterogeneous model of a coffee machine. Then, we use this example all through the chapter to illustrate the syntax and semantics of \bcool. We present the current implementation in the GEMOC studio by executing and validating the coffee machine models. 

\item Chapter~\ref{ch:examples} validates our approach by using as use case the heterogeneous model of a surveillance video system.

\item Finally, we provide the conclusion of this work, highlighting its main contributions and we give some future perspectives in Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusions}.

%\item Section~\ref{sec:coord-lang} presents the main issues in the coordination of behavioral models, and shows how they can be tackled by explicitly capturing coordination patterns at the language level. Section~\ref{sec:interfaceandexample} defines the notion of language behavioral interface by using an example language named Timed Finite State Machine (TFSM). This language is used later in Section~\ref{sec:BCOol} to illustrate \bcool. In Section~\ref{sec:caseStudies}, we validate the approach by using \bcool to capture three coordination patterns between two languages: TFSM and fUML Activities. Section~\ref{sec:related} gives an overview and comparison to related work. Section~\ref{sec:conclu} concludes with a brief summary and a discussion of ongoing and future actions.
	
%\item Finally, we provide the conclusion of this work, highlighting its main contributions and we give some future perspectives in Chapter 7.
