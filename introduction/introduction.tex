	\item The coordination of heterogenenous behavioral models becomes important.
	
	\item Why current approach are not enough.
	\item GEMOC project
	
	\item We propose \bcool ...  
	
	\item In \bcool, coordination patterns are captured .... 
	
	\item To validate the approach, we develop the model of a camera system ....
	
	\item The content of this thesis is organized in .... (outline)
	
	\item Finally, we provide the conclusion of this work, highlighting its main contributions and
