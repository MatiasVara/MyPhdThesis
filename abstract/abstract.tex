	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item In the context of Model Driven Engineering, the design of complex systems involves various, possibly heterogeneous, structural and behavioral models. 
	
	\item The coordination of behavioral models to produce a single integrated model is necessary to provide support for validation and verification. It allows system designers to understand and validate the global and emerging behavior of the system. 
	
	\item However, the manual coordination of models is tedious and error-prone, and current approaches to automate the coordination are bound to a fixed set of coordination patterns. Moreover, they encode the pattern into a tool thus limiting reasoning on the global system behavior.   
	
	\item In this thesis, we propose a Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (\bcool) to reify coordination patterns between specific domains by using coordination operators between the Domain-Specific Modeling Languages used in these domains. 
	
	\item Those operators are then used to automate the coordination of models conforming to these languages. 
	
	\item \bcool has been implemented as plugins for the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) thus providing a complete environment to execute and verify coordinated models.
