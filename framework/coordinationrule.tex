\section{Coordination Rule}
\subsection{Overview}
To capture the specification of a given coordination pattern, approaches specify not only what and when elements must be coordinated, but also how they must be coordinated. Together with a correspondence rule, approaches define a coordination rule that contains the specification of the interaction. In other words, each correspondence has associated a coordination rule that defines its behavioral meaning. 

For example, in~\cite{dinatale}, each correspondence in the mapping model (\ie stereotypes) is translated to a specific glue in C++. The glue encodes how elements of the functional and the platform translation semantics are coordinated. More precisely, the glue is encoded into the translation semantics of the mapping language as method invocation in C++. Similarly, MASCOT~\cite{mascotbib} encodes the coordination rule into the SDL wrappers in C. The SDL engine communicates to the Matlab engine by invoking the methods in the SDL wrappers. Such a protocol is implemented in C. 
			
In Ptolemy~\cite{ptoleframebib} and ModHel'X~\cite{modhelxbib}, composite actors interact with their internal actors by explicitly invoking the methods in their interface. Both the semantics of models and the coordination rule are expressed in Java. While in Ptolemy the coordination rule is fixed, ModHel'X enables the specification of the code between two component interfaces (\ie semantic adaptation). Such a manual adaptation is also done in Java.

\subsection{Discussion}
In the four reviewed approaches, we identified two similarities as follows:
	
\begin{enumerate}
\item The coordination rule is hidden inside a tool and expressed in a general purpose language;
\item The customization of the coordination rule is limited.
\end{enumerate}
		
We want to highlight that the reviewed approaches do not leverage on the state-of-art of Coordination Languages and ADLs. For instance, ADLs have addressed 1) by relying on connectors that make explicit the interaction between components. Furthermore, some ADLs express the glue in a formal language to provide verification and validation of the coordinated system. For example, in a recent work~\cite{varagemoc13bib}, authors based on the approach presented in~\cite{sle13-combemale} to coordinate the behavior of heterogeneous models. The coordination is expressed by specifying constraints in \ccsl between the \mse of the model behavioral interface. Then, by using \ccsl tools, authors provided the execution of the coordinated system. In this approach, the coordination is manually specified between two particular models. However, it illustrates the use of \ccsl as glue to express the coordination.  
		
Regarding to second point, ADLs have well identified the notion of user-defined connector-types that enables a system designer to build domain specific connectors and use them as needed. In the light of these findings, a coordination rule should be explicitly defined by using a formal language.

 		%\item \todo{A recent work~\cite{semanticadaptlang} propose a dedicated language to explicitly specify the semantic adaptation. Currently in ModHel'X, the semantic adaptation is written in java, \ie a general purpose language. Instead, this approach proposes to use a language closed to system designer domain. From DSL code, Java code is generated and implemented into ModHel'X. Since Java code is used, verification and validation of the coordinated system remain limited.}   
 		 		
 		
 		%\item None of the approaches we reviewed really took advantage of state of the art on software architecture and coordination languages. 
 		
 		%\item The notion of user defined connector types as defined by Wright or Reo or Unicon is better formulated the approaches previously presented. Leveraging on such approach to provide coordination rule seems quite intuitive and would bring a clear separation between the computational and coordination activity while allowing the definition of domain specific coordination. 
 		
 		%\item Also, according to the domain addressed by the covered approaches that none of them used a formal language to specify the coordination rule.
 		
 		%\item  Based on state of the art approaches based on formal languages (like BIP or Wright), it can be interesting to experiment the adaptation of a formal language to specify the coordination rule of behavioral patterns between heterogeneous languages.
	
 		%\item A \emph{coordination rule}, which specifies how a set of formal parameters are coordinated. In the case of model composition, this is defined as a \emph{merging} of elements. By relying on the classification proposed in~\cite{clavreulmodelcompo}, the coordination rule is a particular case of \emph{interpretation}. From authors, \emph{Interpretation is what we define as the meaning of the correspondence relationships for a given purpose in a specific context}. Since the final goal of the coordination rule is to coordinate behavioral models, the interpretation is classified as \emph{interaction}.
