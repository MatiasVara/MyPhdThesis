\section{Language Behavioral Interface}
	\subsection{Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The language behavioral interface provides \emph{What?} can be coordinated. A language behavioral interface is a partial representation of the behavioral semantics and syntax of a language. The behavioral interface contains the needed information to coordinate the behavioral of languages. 
		\item In Coordination Languages and ADL, there exists a notion of model behavioral interface. Such interface expose the needed information to ease the coordination of models. The content of the interface varies from one approach to other. However, the main goal is to ease the task of a system designer in order to ease the coordination of models.  
		\item In the case of Coordination Pattern approaches, we identified that approaches base on some knowledge on the semantics and syntax that they compose. Such knowledge is partial. We name this language behavioral interface. 
		\item The concept of language behavioral interface is not presented in the structural framework. 
		\item In the following, we present this concept in relation with the studied approaches. However, such a concept is not always identified as an interface by the approaches.   
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Comparison}
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item In Ptolemy~\cite{ptolemybib} and ModHel'X~\cite{modhelxbib}, models conform to the same abstract syntax based on the actors. The behavioral semantics depends on the Director that implements a Model of Computation. A director encodes the behavioral semantics in Java. Then, to communicate different Directors, the approach is based on a notion of generic language behavioral interface. In this case, the interface is made of methods in Java. The approach forces the prototype of the functions to encode a given model of computation. The approach specifies the semantics of the method in natural language. For instance, a part of the \emph{fire()} function description is: ``\emph{Typically, the fire() method performs the computation associated with an actor}''. It can also be noticed that the name of the director usually brings some semantics to the people aware of Model of Computation and can be considered as part of the language interface. However, using the director name remains very informal. A generic interface enables to provide an homogenous view of the behavioral semantics of different languages. Then, the pattern is captured by specifying how the method from different interfaces are invoked. 
			
			%\item In Ptolemy~\cite{ptolemybib} and ModHel'X~\cite{modhelxbib}, the coordinated models are all conforming a unique abstract syntax but with different behavioral semantics. Both approaches are based on the notion of \emph{Director}, which encodes the behavioral semantics in Java. A \emph{Director} implements a specific Java interface\footnote{the Executable interface, cf.} %\url{http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptexternal/src/ptII/doc/codeDoc/ptolemy/actor/Executable.html}}, which provides an homogeneous view of the behavioral semantics of a language by enforcing the prototype of the functions used to encode the semantics. The semantics behind the methods are given in a natural language. For instance, a part of the \emph{fire()} function description is: ``\emph{Typically, the fire() method performs the computation associated with an actor}''. The function prototypes, together with their informal description provides an homogeneous view of the semantics of the languages, which is used to specify the coordination pattern. It can also be noticed that the name of the director usually brings some semantics to the people aware of Model of Computation and can be considered as part of the language interface. However, using the director name remains very informal.
			
			\item In~\cite{dinatale}, the mapping language only has partial information about the syntax of both the functional and the platform languages. The mapping language references only some of the syntactic elements from both languages (\eg \emph{Task}s and \emph{Cpu}s). In addition, the translational semantics of the mapping language is based on the knowledge about the translational semantics of the platform and functional languages. More precisely the mapping semantics needs to know about the naming conventions from the other translational semantics. In~\cite{dinatale}, this required knowledge is kept implicit and hard coded in the translation semantics of the mapping language. However, this information about the language semantics could be exposed in a language interface to avoid hard coding it. 
			
			\item In Mascot~\cite{mascotbib}, the coordination is not symmetric since Matlab scripts are embedded in an SDL model. \todo{As a consequence the Matlab interface is used but not the SDL interface.} The authors identified two main elements about the Matlab language. First they depict the different kinds of communication used from and to Matlab. Second they characterize the Model of Computation used by the Matlab simulation engine as being Petri Net. They based the coordination on this knowledge so that these pieces of information act as the language interface of the Matlab language. \todo{On the other side, it is mandatory in the Matlab script to use the same name for the stream then the name of the signals from and to the SDL wrappers of the SDL model. Consequently, it means this approach relies on naming convention to specify the correspondence matching.}
		\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Discussion}
	\begin{itemize}
	
	    	\item All the approaches studied retrieve information on the syntax and/or behavioral semantics of the languages they coordinate. Only \cite{ptolemybib} and \cite{modhelxbib} made explicit the notion of interface; \cite{MarcoModels2014} and \cite{mascotbib} retrieved the information implicitly from the definition of the languages. 
	    	Using an explicit language interface is a way to obtain a language independent representation of the behavioral semantics. In this case, the approaches can add support to new languages with a minimum effort since they are seen homogeneously. However, because the language interface definition used in \cite{ptolemybib} and \cite{modhelxbib} provides only a list of functions, it requires a deep understanding of the underlying framework to be able to specify correct coordination patterns. 
	    	\todo{An interesting research direction could be to adapt the notion of interface automata proposed in~\cite{henzingerIA} to specify the acceptable protocol between the calls of the functions that implements the semantics of the language.} 
	    	
	    	\item At the model level, \cite{garlansoftarchbib} explains that there are important benefits of using events (with implicit invocation) in the component interfaces because it provides strong support for reuse and evolution of components. 
	    	In~\cite{coordinainterfacebib}, authors go further by proposing a component interface that contains events but also properties specified in a temporal logic language. These properties abstract the behavior of the components.
	    	
	    	\item \todo{ Several causal representations from the concurrency theory are used to capture event-based behavioral interface. A causal representation captures the concurrency, dependency and conflict relationships among actions in a particular program. For instance, an event structure~\cite{eventStructures} is a partial order of events, which specifies the, possibly timed, causality relations as well as conflict relations (\ie exclusion relations) between actions of a concurrent system. This fundamental model is powerful because it totally abstracts data and program structure to focus on the partial ordering of actions. It specifies, \emph{in extension} and \emph{in order}, the set of actions that can be observed during the program execution. An event structure can also be specified \emph{in intention} to represent the set of observable event structures during an execution (see \eg\cite{tr:ccsl} or \cite{tagmachine}).}
	    	
	    	\item With the goal to provide a rich event based language interface, \cite{sle13combemalebib} proposed to specify a behavioral language interface based on the notion of symbolic event structure. The symbolic event structure is linked to both the abstract syntax and the functions implementing the semantics. It exhibits the concurrency and the causalities between the functions implementing the semantics and link them with the concepts of the language.
	    	
	    	\item \todo{In~\cite{sle13-combemale} elements of event structures are reified at the language level to propose a behavioral interface based on sets of \emph{event types} and \emph{contraints}. Event types (named \dse for Domain Specific Event) are defined in the context of a metaclass of the abstract syntax (\as), and abstract the relevant semantic actions. Jointly with the \dse, related constraints give a symbolic (intentional) representation of an event structure. With  such an interface, the concurrency and time-related aspects of the language behavioral semantics are explicitly exposed and the coordination is event-driven and non intrusive.}
	    	\item \todo{Then, for each model conforming to the language, the model behavioral interface is a specification, in intention, of an event structure whose events (named \mse for Model Specific Event) are instances of the \dse defined in the language interface. While \dse are attached to a metaclass, \mse are linked to one of its instances. The causality and conflict relations of the event structure are a model-specific unfolding of the constraints specified in the language behavioral interface. Just like event structures were initially introduced to unfold the execution of Petri nets, we use them here to unfold the execution of models.}
