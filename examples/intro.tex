\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we validate the use of \bcool through the developing of two coordination operators between the TFSM and Activity language. These operators specify a coordination pattern that synchronizes the entering and leaving of states and the execution of activities. These patterns are common in hierarchical coordination frameworks like Ptolemy~\cite{giraultbib}. However, in frameworks, the semantics of such hierarchical coordination is hidden inside a tool. We propose to make their specification explicit by using \bcool. Then, we use this specification to coordinate and verify the heterogeneous model of surveillance camera system. 

We begin this chapter by presenting the operators together with its \bcool definition. We continue by using these operators to coordinate the model of a surveillance video system. Then, we use the GEMOC studio to validate the coordinated model. To finish this chapter, we compare our approach with current coordination approaches, and finally we conclude.
