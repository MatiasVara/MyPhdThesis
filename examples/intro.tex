\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we validate the use of \bcool through the specification of two coordination operators. Each operator captures a hierarchical coordination pattern between the TFSM and the Activity languages. These patterns are common in coordination frameworks~\cite{giraultbib}, however, their specification is hidden an expressed by using a GPL. In this chapter, we make their specification explicit by using \bcool operators. In addition, we use them to coordinate the models of surveillance video system. 

We organize this chapter as follows. We begin by presenting the operators together with its \bcool definition. We continue by using these operators to coordinate the model of a surveillance video system. We then use the \bcool framework to validate the coordinated model. Afterwards, in the discussion, we compare our approach with current coordination approaches, and finally, we conclude.
