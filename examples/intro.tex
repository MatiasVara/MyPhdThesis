\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we validate the use of \bcool through the developing of two coordination operators between the TFSM and Activity language. These operators specify a hierarchical coordination pattern between in which states from TFSM are coordinated with Activities. Such patterns are common in coordination frameworks~\cite{giraultbib}, however, their specification is hidden inside a tool. We propose to use \bcool in order to make their specification explicit. We illustrate the use of these operators by coordinating the heterogeneous model of surveillance camera system. This chapter is organized as follows. We begin by presenting the operators together with its \bcool definition. We continue by using these operators to coordinate the model of a surveillance video system. We use the \bcool framework to validate the coordinated model. Then, in the discussion, we compare our approach with current coordination approaches, and finally, we conclude.
