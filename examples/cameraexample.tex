\section{Timing and Hierarchical Coordination Operator between TFSM and Activity Languages}
\subsection{Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In this section, we use \bcool to specify two operators: \emph{startActivityWhenEnter} and \emph{AtomicActions}. Each operator captures a coordination pattern between the TFSM and Activity Language. 
		
		\item The \emph{startActivityWhenEnter} operator captures a hierarchical coordination pattern between the TFSM and fUML languages, unlike hierarchical coordination frameworks where the semantics is hidden, this operator explicitly specify how the hierarchical coordination is implemented. In our case, we chose the semantics in which entering a specific state of a TFSM model triggers the execution of a given fUML activity. When leaving a state, several semantic variation points may be chosen. The outgoing transitions from a state can be considered, for instance, as preemptive for the activity model (\ie firing a transition from a state to another preempts the internal activity). Alternatively, the transition can be considered as non-preemptive (\ie the states cannot be left before the associated activity finishes). In this example, we chose non-preemptive transitions. So that the state can be left only after the activity is finished. 
		
		\item In the \emph{AtomicActions} operator, we deal with the temporal aspects of the model coordination. The operator specifies how the time in the TFSM elapses during the execution of the activities that specify the on-entry action of a state. This coordination is also hierarchical, but in this case, only considers the timing aspects. In the TFSM language, each state machine has a \emph{localClock} used to measure the time (see Appendix~\ref{ap:languages}) while the fUML language is untimed. The local clock is a \emph{FSMClock}, which defines a \dse named \emph{ticks} whose occurrences represent a physical time increment. In the fUML language, the duration of activities can be represented as the time between the \dse \emph{startActivity} and \dse \emph{finishActivity} (see Appendix~\ref{ap:languages}). To coordinate the time, it is necessary to specify the number of \emph{ticks} of the local clock between the occurrence of the \dse \emph{startActivity} and \emph{finishActivity}. Thus the operator enforces the execution of the ``internal'' activity to be atomic with respect to the time in the TFSM model. As a result, there is no occurrence of the \dse ticks of the corresponding local clock during the execution of the activity.

		\item In the following, we define these operators in \bcool. Then, we use them to coordinate the heterogeneous model of a surveillance camera system (see Figure~\ref{fig:camerasystem}). We finish this section by studying the coordinated model.

	\subsection{Definition of the Coordination Operators}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \bcool specification is organized around two operators: \emph{startActivityWhenEnter} and \emph{AtomicActions}.

		CoordinationRule: 
		LoopFromStartToFinishNonPeemptive (enterState, leaveState, activityStart, activityStop)
		end operator;
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		
		\item The \emph{startActivityWhenEnter}  (Listing~\ref{lst:bcoolStartActivityWhenEnter}) operator coordinates the action of entering into a state with the start of an activity so that when a state is entered, the execution of the activity is started synchronously. Then, the operator expresses that the leaving of the state follows the termination of the activity.   
		
		 \item Entering into a state is identified by the \textit{entering} \dse defined in the context of State. Instances of such \dse have to be coordinated with instances of the \textit{startActivity} \dse. Similarly, leaving a state is identified by \dse \textit{leaving} and finishing an activity is identified by \dse \textit{finishActivity}. 
		 
		 \item To identify pairs of events, we compare the \emph{onEnterAction} and the name of the activities (Listing~\ref{lst:bcoolStartActivityWhenEnter}: line 6). OnEnterAction is a method defined in the context of State (see Figure~\ref{fig:tfsmmm}). It specifies the name of the activity that the state represents. 
		  
		 
		 \item For the coordination rule, we have selected this semantics in which entering a state synchronously triggers the starting of an activity. Then, the coordination rule has to specify a causality between the finishing of the activity and the leaving of the state.     
		 
		 \item To do so, we rely on the event relation \emph{LoopFromStartToFinishNonPeemptive}. Figures~\ref{ch:examples} shows its graphical representation in \moccml. This is illustrated by the transition between the states \emph{waitEnterState} and \emph{canLoop}. The event relation specifies an strong synchronization between the selected pairs of \dse \emph{entering} and \emph{startActivity}. The transition is only taken when both the state entered and the activity is started. Then, in the canLoop state, the activity can freely execute (\ie the events startActivity and finishActivity are not constrained). Then, the state can be left (the modeleave occurs) only after the activity finishes.

CoordinationRule: 
 AtomicExec (activityStart, activityStop, timeTicks)
end operator;
\end{lstlisting}
		
		\item Listing~\ref{lst:AtomicActions} contains the definition of operator named \emph{AtomicActions}. The operator selects instances of \dse startActivity and finishActivity by using their context. As a result, the pairs selected identify the starting and finishing of an activity. Then, we select the activities that represent a state (Listing~\ref{lst:AtomicActions}: line 12). To do so, we use the onEnterAction defined in the context of State. Then, we use the selected instances of \dse entering to select instances of \dse ticks of the corresponding local clock (Listing~\ref{lst:AtomicActions}: line 25). The coordination rule must specify how much time is consumed during the execution of an activity.
		
		\item In this example, we consider the execution of the activity is atomic. So that, during the execution of the activity, there are non ticks of the tfsm local clock. In other words, the local clock can only ticks only after the activity has finished its execution. 
		
		\item \todo{To do so, we rely on the \moccml event relation \emph{AtomicExec}}

		\end{figure}
					
		%First, we use the event expression \emph{SampledBy} to create a local event named \emph{sampled} which ticks always after the startActivity instance, and coincides with the occurrences of the instance of the corresponding \dse ticks (Listing~\ref{fig:bcooltimeinactions}: line 27). Second, we synchronize the event sampled with the finishing of the activity by using a causality relation (Listing~\ref{fig:bcooltimeinactions}: line 28). This results for instances of ticks to occur only after the activity has finished its execution.
	
		\item The use of the library to define domain specific relations has two major benefits. First, once defined in the library, event relations can be reused in various \bcool specifications. Second, by defining a dedicated event relation, we improve the readability and modularity of the \bcool specification.

	\subsection{Use of the Operators in a Surveillance Camera System}
	In this section, we develop the heterogeneous model of a surveillance camera system (see Figure~\ref{fig:camerasystem}). To model different aspects of the system, we use the TFSM and the fUML languages. Then, we use the operators developed in the previous section to generate the coordination specification. 
	
	The video surveillance system is composed of a camera and a battery control. The camera takes pictures by using either the \emph{JPEG2000} or \emph{JPG} algorithm and is powered by a battery. When the battery is low, the battery control makes the camera use the \emph{JPG} algorithm, thus reducing the quality of the picture but also the energy consumption~\cite{encodingcomparison}. When the battery is high, the JPEG2000 algorithm is used instead. In Figure~\ref{fig:camerasystem}, the activity diagrams named \emph{BatteryControl} represents the simple algorithm implemented in the battery control. At the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:camerasystem}, the TFSM named \emph{CameraControl} represents a partial view of the camera. When the TFSM model is in state \emph{BatteryHigh}, the JPEG2000 algorithm is used (specified by the activity diagram on the right of Figure~\ref{fig:camerasystem} named \emph{doJPEG2000}). When in state \emph{BatteryLow}, the encoding algorithm is replaced by a mere JPEG algorithm represented by an activity named \emph{doJPEG} (The activity is not shown for lack of space). The transition from one state to another is done when either the \emph{BatteryIsHigh} event or the \emph{BatteryIsLow} event occurs, depending on the current state.

		\label{fig:camerasystem}
	\end{figure}
	
	To coordinate the models, we have to specify a timing and hierarchical coordination between the states of the TFSM CameraControl and the activities doJPEG and doJPEG2000. In addition, we have to synchronize the activity BatteryControl and the TFSM CameraControl by coordinating the corresponding Action and FSMEvent. Applying the four operators on these simple models, we generate the expected coordination specification. The coordination generated by using our approach corresponds to eight \ccsl relations.
	 
	In \bcool, the generated coordination specification conforms to the CCSL language. Since we are using a formal language, the integrator can execute and verify the coordination specification of the system.
	
	By using the language workbench presented in Section~\ref{section:bcoollengbench}, the coordination specification generated for the surveillance camera system can be executed and analysed. More precisely, we are able to execute the coordination specification by using TimeSquare, and to explore the state space. For lack of space we do not show the timing output of the execution of the surveillance camera system, however, the models together with a procedure to execute and verify them can be found in the companion web site.
