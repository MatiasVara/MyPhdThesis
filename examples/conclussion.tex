\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have used our approach to tackle the different facets of the coordination of the models of a surveillance camera system. We have started by building a set of coordination operators between the TFSM and Activity language. These operators capture a hierarchical coordination pattern between states and activities. We have shown the use of \moccml to define event relations. In particular, we have shown its ability to define state-based relation that eases the developing of complex relations. Afterwards, we have used these operators to coordinate the heterogeneous model of surveillance camera system. We have shown the use of \bflow to specify which operators apply on which models. Then, we have used the modeling workbench to execute the system.
