\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have used \bcool to specify two operators between the TFSM and Activity language that we have used latter to coordinate heterogeneous model of a surveillance camera system. These operators capture a hierarchical coordination pattern between states and activities. We have shown the use of \moccml to define event relations. Afterwards, we have used these operators to coordinate the heterogeneous model of surveillance camera system. We have shown the use of \bflow to specify which operators apply on which models. Then, we have used the modeling workbench to execute the system. 

In the next chapter, we summarize the most important contributions of this thesis and we propose various perspective paths that could be a guide to continue this work.
